# Parallelising_python
Parallelising tasks makes it easier to run and consume less memory.
This is a sample for synchronous and asynchronous processing.
Lists,tuples,arrays and dataframes can be processed parallely consuming less memory but taking a little bit of extra time. If you have more than 4 processors,do give this a try.
